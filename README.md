This is a snake game, made with basic HTML, Javascript and CSS, 
where you can change the size of the board, the amount of tiles you have to work with and game speed at will.

I gave up at making the tail. Maybe I'll come back and finish it eventually. Right now, it is a block moving around and collecting fruit. 
You can still change the basic values as planned, but well...

...it's not much of a snake without a tail, is it?
